<p class="shuffle">1 &mdash; LET’S LOOK AT THIS AGAIN. THEY WANTED A COMMUNITY, NOT A PROGRAMME. A SPACE TO CARE FOR EACH OTHER, TO PLAY, EXPLORE AND BE DAFT WITHOUT JUDGEMENT, TO BE TOGETHER DEVELOPING FRIENDSHIPS FORMED ON TRUST AND SUPPORT. <span class="name">Laura Parke</span></p>

<p class="shuffle">3 &mdash; CULTURE IS JUST THE MATERIAL OF OUR LIVES. IT’S THE THINGS THAT WE GENERATE AND THAT WE LIVE AROUND, BY THE PROCESS OF BEING WHO WE ARE: LIVING WHERE WE LIVE; THE BONDS WE WERE BORN TO; THE FAMILIES THAT WE GREW UP IN; WITH THE NEIGHBOURS THAT WE HAVE. THAT IS CULTURE. <span class="name">Emma Warren</span></p>

<p class="shuffle">4 &mdash; HAVING A DOCUMENTARY OR PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBITION OR A BOOK ABOUT A PLACE MARKS IT AS SPECIAL. IT’S VALUABLE. IT CAN BE A USEFUL ELEMENT IN THE ARSENAL OF PROTECTION THAT WE INCREASINGLY NEED TO HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL WHEN IT COMES TO CULTURAL SPACE AND COMMUNITIES AND ENTITIES. <span class="name">Emma Warren</span></p>

<p class="shuffle">5 &mdash; THE PROCESS OF GRAPHIC DESIGN IS OFTEN INHERENTLY COLLABORATIVE AND THUS COMMUNAL AND SOCIAL AND ENGAGED. WE CONSIDER OUR PARTICIPATING HANDS AND THOSE OF OTHERS WITH CARE. IN COLLABORATION WE SEE COMMUNITY AND WE SEEK TO CONNECT WITH CONSIDERATION. <span class="name">Rose Nordin</span></p>


<p class="shuffle">7 &mdash; “IF IT’S NOT HEART WORK IT’S NOT ARTWORK” AND “THE PROCESS IS THE PRIZE”. THOSE ARE THE RULES AND YOU HAVE TO ABIDE BY THEM. THE MOST IMPACTFUL THINGS I’VE MADE HAVE COME FROM A SMALL INTERNAL DESIRE THAT CREATED SOMETHING WHICH RESONATED WITH OTHER PEOPLE. <span class="name">Andre Anderson</span></p>

<p class="shuffle">8 &mdash; WE ARE CONCEPTUAL AND CRITICAL BEYOND THE LIMITATIONS OF AESTHETIC TRENDS AND STYLES AND THIS IS VISIBLE IN OUR WORK. WE ARE CUSTODIANS OF THE CONTENT AND MESSAGES WE WORK TO COMMUNICATE AND TREAD CAREFULLY WITH OUR RESPONSIBILITIES. <span class="name">Rose Nordin</span></p>

<p class="shuffle">10 &mdash; “IF YOU ARE LIVING THE REST OF YOUR LIFE AT A CERTAIN INTENSIFIED RHYTHM, IT JUST DOESN’T FIT THE RHYTHM OF CONVERSATION. YOU CAN’T HURRY. THERE HAS TO BE A CERTAIN SPACE AROUND CONVERSATION TO ALLOW IT TO EITHER COME OR GO, TO LAST A SHORT TIME OR A LONG TIME, OR TO ORGANISE AROUND ESTABLISHED CHUNKS” <span class="name">Stuart Hall</span></p>

<p class="shuffle">11 &mdash; LOOKING TO THE FUTURE. ANY SUCCESSES THAT WE’VE SEEN THIS YEAR ARE DUE TO THE DETERMINATION, HARD WORK AND GRIT OF STUDENTS AND EDUCATORS – WE DON’T YET UNDERSTAND THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THESE CHANGES, BUT WE DO KNOW WHAT WE HAVE LOST HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT. <span class="name">Laura Parke</span></p>

<p class="shuffle">12 &mdash;  THERE ARE ALWAYS COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR SKILLS TO BE APPLIED TO. HOWEVER, WE ARE CONSCIOUS OF THE LIMITATIONS OF OUR CONTRIBUTIONS AS GRAPHIC DESIGNERS IN COMMERCIAL SCENARIOS. WE SEEK A BALANCE OF THE PRACTICAL, THE CONCEPTUAL AND THE POLITICAL IN OUR PRACTICE. <span class="name">Rose Nordin</span></p>
