### Clay Skincare
{:.d-inline}
Clay is an eco-conscious skincare brand that stands out amongst its competitors by utilising bold colours and impactful design. The branding for this project ties together through various design decisions and multiple consistent elements that appear throughout the packaging, as well as promotional items that help link the whole identity together. The colours, design assets and logos all work cohesively to create an expressive and colourful outcome that is in line with the eco-warrior stance Clay has on environmental change and reflects the passion and value Clay has for making great skincare.
