### Fabric District Brand Identity
{:.d-inline}
A refreshed place-making brand identity for the Fabric District reflecting the area's own identity and life. This entailed re-establishing what makes the district different and unique from existing areas such as the Baltic Triangle and Bold Street. The most prominent and longstanding themes of the district have been those relating to fabric and fabrication, hence making Islington the historic Fabric District of Liverpool. The identity reflects the industrious heritage of the area with a fresh and unique look and feel to attract a diverse audience back to the area, all whilst retaining the spirit and attitude for existing businesses to thrive.
