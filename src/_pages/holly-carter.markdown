## Holly Carter
{:.d-inline}
### Lookalike
{:.d-inline}
A perfect bound publication, exploring the complexities and assumptions of being a twin, through a first-hand perspective. Twins often struggle to cultivate their identities, as many are unaware of the implications of comments they make. With similarities both minute and immense, their comparison unsurprisingly lasts their lifetime. This often results in identity crises, and deterioration of self-esteem, due to their lack of conformed individuality. Lookalike was created to acknowledge the implications of innocent yet unappreciated comments, both aesthetically and character-based, through the use of coloured overlays and tone. Their separation is a direct representation of my and my sister's relationship. A relationship that fluctuated dramatically due to our continual resentment towards one another. Lookalike, simply, acknowledges and celebrates our differences as we should have done years ago.
