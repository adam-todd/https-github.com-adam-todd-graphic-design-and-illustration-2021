### Jemima & The Jellymen
{:.d-inline}
A colouring-in comic book about a girl whose packet of jelly sweets suddenly come to life. This story is very personal to me as it is based on bedtime stories my Dad made up for me when I was little. The comic is printed on newsprint and comes with a stackable coloured pencil allowing interactive reading for children.
