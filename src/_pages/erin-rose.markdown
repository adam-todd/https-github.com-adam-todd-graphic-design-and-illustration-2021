## Erin Rose

### Mindful Beauty
{:.d-inline}
A branding project for a beauty line concept. The project includes social media, packaging, advertising and a website. I chose to use calming colours and gradients to represent a relaxed and carefree mindset. I wanted to focus the ethos of this brand on diversity, sustainability and giving back. As I have worked with a lot of makeup brands and one day aspire to create my own, I wanted to design a brand that fits with my own vision of the values I believe a brand should have. For example I wanted Mindful to be considerate of its impact on the planet through being cruelty free and having 100% recyclable packaging. The main message of this brand is to promote a positive mindset and self love.
