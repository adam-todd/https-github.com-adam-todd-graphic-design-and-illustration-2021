### Glastonbury 2022
{:.d-inline}
As a result of Coronavirus in 2020 festivals came to a halt and due to the restrictions, this followed through to 2021. To ease the public disappointment Glastonbury created a virtual lineup. Using this as a starting point I wanted to rebrand the festival for the planned 2022 event and to help bring live music back to the public. This has been done with a series of main stage posters, banners, signage, merch, stage visuals and festival passes.
