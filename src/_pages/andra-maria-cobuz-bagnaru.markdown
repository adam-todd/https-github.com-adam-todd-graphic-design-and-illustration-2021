### Gaia
{:.d-inline}
The "Gaia" project is based on thorough research of some of the most interesting Greek myths such as; Pandoraâ€™s Box, Pegasus, Apple of Discord, Polyphemus, and Trick at Mecone; and in-depth analysis of the main symbols and the visual key elements I extracted from the legends. As most of the Greek tales are written in the form of theatre plays, I considered that the most suitable outcome for translating them into visual representations is through 3d modelling, scenography and studio installations. I aimed to achieve a strange and futuristic aesthetic, blending pastel colours that attract the viewer with obscure and unsettling elements such as meat, plastic, transparent glass, water, smoke, all brought together by appropriate lighting and uncommon perspectives.
