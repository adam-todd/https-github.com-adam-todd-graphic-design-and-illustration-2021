### Bad Passage
{:.d-inline}
A visual representation of small-town living in a rural community in the UK formatted as a fold-out map. Before folding out onto a hand-drawn map Bad Passage tells various first-hand accounts of village life, stories of trauma and loss and brutality that juxtapose this cultural ideal of the quaint English village. Each story is accompanied by an embroidered image that frames an overall stifling atmosphere of country life.
