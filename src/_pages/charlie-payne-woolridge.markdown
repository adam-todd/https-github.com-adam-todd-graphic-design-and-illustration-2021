### Rinse FM App
{:.d-inline}
Rinse has dominated London’s radio airwaves for over a decade as a hub of the capital’s thriving urban music community. From Dubstep to Grime to House and everything in between, Rinse has championed London’s diverse cultural needs, reaching massively under-represented communities with grass-roots music. ​

I designed this app with the aim of creating an easy one-stop location for all of Rinse FM's music, as an avid listener of Rinse FM I personally have needed a way to listen to the Radio on-the-go as I don't live in London where the radio is accessible. In the app you can access a personalised homepage and favourites page that allows you to save music in your own library and create playlists that best fit your genre of music. The user can also use the live radio to listen to music live and on the go, there is also access to the merchandise shop for ease of use of things like Apple pay and Google pay.
