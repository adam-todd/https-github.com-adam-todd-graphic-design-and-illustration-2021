### Anything Can Be Art?
{:.d-inline}
‘Anything Can Be Art’ presents the idea that art is subjective and if you look at anything with an open mind it can be viewed as ‘art’. People are very quick to judge pieces of art when they are viewing them, I wanted to show just how flexible the label is. To someone who agrees with the statement that ‘anything can be art’ this project was intended to really push the boundaries of it. It was to show that even something as obscure as modern structures can become and can influence pieces of art. The publication raises the question, if the illustrations and prints are ‘art’ then why can’t the structures themselves be art too?
