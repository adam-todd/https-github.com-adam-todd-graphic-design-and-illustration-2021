### The Pillars Of Meditation
{:.d-inline}
An illustrative book cover collection for Penguin UK. Nine covers make up the series. Aimed at anyone interested in the practice of mindfulness and/or anyone looking to make a change in their life. The project is set up to answer these key questions. Why meditate? What are the benefits, and how are they measured? How do you learn to meditate? Is there a difference between meditation and mindfulness? Will you need to sit on cushions and find perfect silence? These are all valid questions. Itâ€™s time to take a step back and look at the basics.
