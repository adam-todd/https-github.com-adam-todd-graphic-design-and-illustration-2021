### Self Control
{:.d-inline}
This short film was created in response to the 2021 Concord Art Prize using Stravinsky’s The Rite of Spring. The song’s narrative follows the sacrificial dance of a pagan virgin, which was controversial for the time and caused outrage in the audience when first performed. This was adapted into a modern day scenario about the effects of overworking and how it can be self destructive with mental and physical effects.
