### This Is Alex
{:.d-inline}
A short film dedicated to my younger brother Alex, who has a rare disability, but does not let it define him in any way. The past 16 years have consisted of so many highs, but also many, many major lows. The coronavirus pandemic really has made me realise how much we cannot take our loved ones for granted. The reality of things is that I donâ€™t know how long I will have the pleasure of Alex being in my life; this film shows how much of a mark he has made and continues to make in all of our lives daily. His love for life shows how small our day-to-day problems are. Life is far too short to not be grateful for the little things. We focus so much of our time on negativity, worries, and insecurities in ourselves and the people around us that sometimes it is hard to see the bigger picture and how lucky we actually are.
