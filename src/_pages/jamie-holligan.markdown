### Revolution Gothic & Revolution Slab
{:.d-inline}
Whilst looking through some examples of old printed advertisements I noticed a few characters I liked the look of and so I decided to trace them. Further investigation revealed that this particular font was only made in bold (Modern Gothic c.1907) and so I set out to make a full character set from the rough, incomplete specimens I had collected. Once I had a couple of working character sets, I made some images to use in combination with my Revolution Gothic and Revolution Slab character sets showing them in operation.
