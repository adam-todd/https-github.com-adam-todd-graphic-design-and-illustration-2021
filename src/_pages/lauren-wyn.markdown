### Museum of The ick
{:.d-inline}
Museum of the ick is a mock organisation generated to share a collection of experiences people have encountered with the "ick". The ick is a new relationship phenomenon fabricated by the younger generation. Have you ever felt a sudden repulsive, cringe feeling when you have a romantic contact with someone: and become almost immediately put off by them? – that’s the ick talking. Through my research journey, I noticed there are a variety of peculiar stories floating around on social media, so why not build a space to store away these uncomfortable circumstances? Aiming to create a humorous yet relatable experience. For this bizarre but necessary concept, I created branding, web design, product design, advertisement, Instagram content, and infographics. All the data included within this project was developed from a questionnaire I produced which gathered 135 responses within 48 hours. The aim was to find out who exactly experiences the ick? Was it just young heterosexual women? The answer is no, I was extremely shocked but satisfied by the responses as I found out even people aged 55+ and of different sexualities and genders realised after reading a description of the ick they had once experienced this situation-ship, therefore Museum of the ick wants to make this known to all. This playful but formal platform was constructed to have a serious tone to make it even more comical but also every detail has been considered - from the branding to the Museum’s phone number.
