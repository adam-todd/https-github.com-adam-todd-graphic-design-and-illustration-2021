### Props for Film and TV
{:.d-inline}
I have taken my favourite tv show, film, and book, and have brought them to life by creating graphic props for them, such as posters, signs and postcards. I have chosen to base my work on the tv show, Stranger Things; the film, The Hunger Games; and the book, Six of Crows, by Leigh Bardugo.
