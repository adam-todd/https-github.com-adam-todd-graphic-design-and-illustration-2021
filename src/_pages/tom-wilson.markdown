### Left In Unity
{:.d-inline}
A visual identity and promotion project. With the current state of UK politics, Labour purging socialists from the party, etc, I felt there was a real gap in the political landscape for a party committed to left-wing politics. Using Jeremy Corbynâ€™s Peace and Justice project manifesto, I transformed those policies and beliefs into a political party that people could get behind. I chose the name Left In Unity, as that is precisely what the party is aiming for; unifying the left to become one stronger force in politics.
