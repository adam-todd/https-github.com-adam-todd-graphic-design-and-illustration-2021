### The Celebration Of Films
{:.d-inline}
A series of spread proposals created for an interactive coffee table book, in honour of artistic cinematography.​​​​​​​ The films featured are extremely creative and unique. The book explores and celebrates the skills involved in creating the films that we love, whilst also attempting to kick start a new wave of appreciation for cinema that has been lost in a post-covid world. The films featured are Lost in Translation, City of God, Nightcrawler, and Trainspotting. The book contains spinning wheels, pull tabs, QR codes and tip-ins - all designed to involve the reader whilst also illustrating the themes of the films.
