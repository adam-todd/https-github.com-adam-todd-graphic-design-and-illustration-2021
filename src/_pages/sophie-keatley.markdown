### Keep On Dancing
{:.d-inline}
This video looks at the journey house music has been on since the 1980s specifically relating to Liverpool. It explores the origins and how house music was introduced to Liverpool, looking at the early acid house raves and then the superclubs which followed, such as 051 and Cream. This video can be seen as a visual timeline that picks out the different trends and styles but also the ups and downs of the dance music scene and the perseverance of the people just wanting to continue to dance, COVID being the latest setback.
