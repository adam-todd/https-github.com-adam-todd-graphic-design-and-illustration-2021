### Collections

"We are but the sum of our collections, of what we collect". This project explores the nature of collecting as a subject, a habit and human behaviour. The publication presents excerpts from text and poetry about collecting, questioning what, how and why we collect things alongside my own collected objects and ephemera. It is informed by themes of sentimentality and human nature.
