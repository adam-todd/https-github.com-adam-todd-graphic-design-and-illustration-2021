### The Yeodel Rave
{:.d-inline}
The music industry has been hit hard by Coronavirus, with live performance revenue the biggest casualty. The music industry is so intrinsically linked with large audiences and live experiences, and when the seriousness of the outbreak became evident, the industry had to act quickly to stay afloat. TYR is a music events company based in Liverpool that has struggled financially during the Covid-19 outbreak. I have used my skillset to help the company expand from an events-only organisation into a record label with a functional online store with the option to buy merch and stream music.
