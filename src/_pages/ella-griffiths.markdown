### Footwear of 1990's Britpop
{:.d-inline}
This project explores the footwear of the 1990s and the musicians who made certain shoes so iconic. I focused solely on British bands of the ’90s that were part of the Britpop Genre, such as Oasis, Blur, Suede, Pulp, and The Verve. Thoroughly researching each band's history, members, and most importantly style and shoe preference. For example, Oasis’ Liam Gallagher was often seen sporting a pair of the classic Adidas Gazelle. There are eight A1-size posters in total, each has a section on the history of the particular shoe and an insight into the period of the 90s the musician is linked to. All eight images were produced using Lino printing. When creating each linocut I ensured to keep a lot of the texture and noise within each print as I felt as though this really fit with the theme of the project and the ‘grungy’ feel of the ’90s. I also took some pictures in the Baltic Triangle to make some mock-ups of the posters in location.
