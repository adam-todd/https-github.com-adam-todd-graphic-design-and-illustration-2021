A childrenâ€™s subscription box investigating space exploration and science. Each pack contains a 3D printed model of their favourite space probe to assemble. Some parts are colour coded, but they are plain for kids to paint over in a few instances. The brochure contains space missions of the probes and fascinating facts for kids to learn. On the flip side, there are easy to follow assembly guidelines with the 3D floating illustration of the model. Which, after unfolding, becomes an A2 poster.
