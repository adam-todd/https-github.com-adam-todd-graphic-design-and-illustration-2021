### Tidy Mind
{:.d-inline}
A collection of Risograph publications documenting odd fragments of my daily experience of anxiety. The little things that bother me, the ways I keep my hands busy, the strange rules I live by, and insights into the utter nonsense that is my internal monologue. The collection is fragmented because for me there is no one way I feel or experience anxiety and the feelings are ever-changing, something that will bother me one week may never bother me again or bother me consistently forever. But I felt these four publications best represent my current mindset.
